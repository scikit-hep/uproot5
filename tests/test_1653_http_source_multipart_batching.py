"""
Regression tests for https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/pull/1653
(part of https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/issues/1646).

Covers:
- ``HTTPSource.chunks`` range-batching: every batch's ``Range`` header must
  list exactly the ranges in that batch, and the batches together must cover
  every requested range exactly once (the old code used a ``ranges[j:j+i]``
  slice that built a superset on the 2nd+ overflow and dropped the final batch
  when the overflow fell on the last range).
- ``HTTPSource.__exit__`` must mark the source closed so a later ``chunk()``
  raises ``OSError`` instead of hanging on a dead worker pool.
- ``HTTPResource.next_header`` must consume all part headers up to the blank
  line, so a ``Content-Range`` that is not the last header does not shift the
  part payload.
