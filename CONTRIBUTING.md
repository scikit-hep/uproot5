# Contributing to uproot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **uproot**! uproot is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

This guide will help you get started with contributing.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/uproot5.git
   cd uproot
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:

   We recommend using a conda environment. You can reproduce the full developer environment with:

   ```bash
   conda create -n uproot-py313 python=3.13
   conda activate uproot-py313

   # Add conda-forge channel and prioritize it
   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda config --set channel_priority strict

   # Install dependencies
   conda install xrootd
   conda install root
   conda install pandas
   conda install dask
   conda install minio

   # pip-only dependencies
   pip install scikit-hep-testdata
   pip install rangehttpserver
   pip install boost_histogram
   pip install hist
   pip install dask_awkward
   pip install awkward-pandas
   pip install pytest-timeout
   pip install fsspec-xrootd

   # Run local HTTP server (if needed for test data)
   python -m RangeHTTPServer
   ```

4. **Install Uproot in editable mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ."[dev,test]"
   ```

## üåø Branching and Naming Conventions

- Always work on a **feature branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b YOUR_USERNAME/my-cool-feature
  ```
- Use descriptive names, such as:
  - `fix_streamer-parsing`
  - `feature_custom-interpretation-api`
  - `docs_improve-tutorials`

---

## üé® Code Style

- Use **pre-commit** for automatic linting, style issues, and formatting:
  ```bash
  pre-commit run --all

---

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

Uproot uses **pytest** for testing.

To run the full test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests -ss -vv
```

To run a specific test module:
```bash
pytest tests/test_my_module.py
```

Some tests may depend on having ROOT or XRootD installed. These are covered in the environment setup.

## üîÉ Submitting a Pull Request

1. Make sure all tests pass and your code is cleanly formatted.
2. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin YOUR_USERNAME/my-cool-feature
   ```
3. Open a pull request (PR) from your fork to the `main` branch of [scikit-hep/uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot).
4. Fill in the PR template and explain what you did and why.
5. Be responsive to feedback from reviewers‚Äîwe‚Äôre all here to help!

---

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug is already reported on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot/issues).
2. If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot/issues/new/choose) and provide:
   - A minimal reproducible example
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Version info (`python -m uproot --version`)
   - Any relevant stack trace or logs

---

## üí° Requesting Features

1. Search the issues to see if a similar feature has been discussed.
2. If not, open a **Feature Request** issue and describe:
   - What problem the feature solves
   - A suggested implementation or interface (if applicable)
   - Any related prior art in other libraries or experiments

---

## üìö Improving Documentation

Documentation lives in the `docs-sphinx/` folder and is built using **Sphinx**. To build locally
make sure you have Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs theme installed in your virtualenv:
```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
```
Navigate to your docs folder and invoke the Sphinx builder to produce HTML in the _build/html directory:
```
cd docs-sphinx
sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
```
Once it finishes, open:
```
open _build/html/index.html
```

You can also suggest improvements to examples, tutorials, and API references.
