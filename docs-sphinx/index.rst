:raw-html:`</p>`

|br| Uproot is a library for reading and writing ROOT files in pure Python and NumPy.

Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, Uproot is only an I/O library, primarily intended to stream data into machine learning libraries in Python. Unlike PyROOT and root_numpy, Uproot does not depend on C++ ROOT. Instead, it uses Numpy to cast blocks of data from the ROOT file as Numpy arrays.

How to install
==============

Uproot can be installed `from PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/uproot>`__ using pip. `Awkward Array <https://pypi.org/project/awkward>`__ is optional but highly recommended:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install uproot awkward

Uproot is also available using `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/uproot>`__ (in this case, `Awkward Array <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/awkward>`__ is automatically installed):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge uproot

If you have already added ``conda-forge`` as a channel, the ``-c conda-forge`` is unnecessary. Adding the channel is recommended because it ensures that all of your packages use compatible versions (see `conda-forge docs <https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge>`__):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda update --all

Documentation
=============

**ROOT** is a C++ toolkit for data analysis, part of which is the ROOT file format. Over an exabyte of particle physics data are stored in ROOT files around the world.

**Uproot** is a Python implementation of ROOT I/O, independent of the ROOT toolkit itself (including ROOT's Python interface, PyROOT).

- If you need help understanding ROOT and its ecosystem, see the `ROOT project documentation <https://root.cern/get_started/>`__.
- If you know what a ROOT file is but are unfamiliar with Uproot, see the :doc:`basic`.
- If you are migrating from an older version to Uproot 4 or 5, see the :doc:`uproot3-to-4`.
- If you need detailed descriptions of a class's properties or a function's parameters, see the left-bar on this site (≡ button on mobile) or use ``help`` in Python, ``?`` or shift-tab in iPython/Jupyter.

Getting help
============

- Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/issues>`__.
- If you have a "How do I...?" question, start a `GitHub Discussion <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/discussions>`__ with category "Q&A".
- Alternatively, ask about it on `StackOverflow with the [uproot] tag <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/uproot>`__. Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.
- To ask questions in real time, try the Gitter `Scikit-HEP/uproot <https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/uproot>`__ chat room.
