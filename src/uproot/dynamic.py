"""
This module is initially empty, a repository for dynamically adding new classes.

The purpose of this namespace is to allow :doc:`uproot.model.VersionedModel`
classes that were automatically generated from ROOT ``TStreamerInfo`` to be
pickled, with the help of :doc:`uproot.model.DynamicModel`.

In `Python 3.7 and later <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562>`__, attempts
to extract items from this namespace generate new :doc:`uproot.model.DynamicModel`
classes, which are used as a container in which data from pickled
:doc:`uproot.model.VersionedModel` instances are filled.
