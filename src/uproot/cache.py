"""
This module defines simple, thread-safe cache classes satisfying the
``MutableMapping`` protocol.

The :doc:`uproot.cache.LRUCache` implements a least-recently used eviction
policy that limits the number of items in the cache (used as an
``object_cache``).

The :doc:`uproot.cache.LRUArrayCache` implements the same policy, limiting the
total number of bytes, as reported by ``nbytes``.
