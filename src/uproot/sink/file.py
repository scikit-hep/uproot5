This module defines a physical layer for writing local files.

Defines a :doc:`uproot.sink.file.FileSink`, which can wrap a Python file-like object
that has ``read``, ``write``, ``seek``, ``tell``, and ``flush`` methods and has a
context manager (Python's ``with`` statement) to ensure that files are properly closed
(although files are flushed after every object-write).

        urlpath_or_file_like (str, Path, or file-like object): If a string or Path, a
            filesystem URL that specifies the file to open by fsspec. If a file-like object, it
            must have ``read``, ``write``, ``seek``, ``tell``, and ``flush`` methods.
        mode ("create", "recreate", or "update"): Like ROOT's ``TFile`` options.
            ``"create"`` raises ``FileExistsError`` if the path already exists,
            ``"recreate"`` truncates an existing file (or a file-like object that has
            a ``truncate`` method), and ``"update"`` keeps its contents. In all three,
            a missing path is created along with its parent directories.

    An object that can write (and read) files on a local or remote filesystem.
    It can be initialized from a file-like object (already opened) or a filesystem URL.
    If initialized from a filesystem URL, fsspec is used to open the file.
    In this case the file is opened in the first read or write operation.
