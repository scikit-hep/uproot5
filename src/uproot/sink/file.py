This module defines a physical layer for writing local files.

Defines a :doc:`uproot.sink.file.FileSink`, which can wrap a Python file-like object
that has ``read``, ``write``, ``seek``, ``tell``, and ``flush`` methods and has a
context manager (Python's ``with`` statement) to ensure that files are properly closed
(although files are flushed after every object-write).
