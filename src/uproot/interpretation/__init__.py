This module defines procedures for interpreting data in ``TTrees`` as arrays.

All interpretations must be subclasses of
:doc:`uproot.interpretation.Interpretation`.

See :doc:`uproot.interpretation.identify.interpretation_of` for heuristics
that determine the default interpretation of a
:doc:`uproot.behaviors.TBranch.TBranch`.

class Interpretation:
    """
    Abstract class for all interpretations of ``TBranch`` data as arrays.

    The interpretation cycle consists of:

    1. Producing temporary arrays from each uncompressed ``TBasket``.
    2. Combining those temporary arrays for the whole range of entries
       requested between ``entry_start`` and ``entry_stop`` in
       :ref:`uproot.behaviors.TBranch.HasBranches.arrays` or
       :ref:`uproot.behaviors.TBranch.TBranch.array`, or by ``entry_step``
       in :ref:`uproot.behaviors.TBranch.TBranch.iterate`.
    3. Trimming the combined array to the exact entry range requested.
       (``TBasket`` boundaries might not align with the requested entry range.)
    4. Passing the combined, trimmed temporary array to a selected
       :doc:`uproot.interpretation.library.Library` for finalization
       and possibly grouping.
